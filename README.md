Music Genre Classification Using Custom-Built Convolutional Neural Network

"music_genre_cnn_melody_spectrogram.ipynb" is the code for training the melody spectrograms using the custom-built CNN.

"music_genre_cnn_custom_spectrogram.ipynb" is the code for training the custom spectrograms using the custom-built CNN. For a step-by-step explanation, please move to music_genre_cnn_melody_spectrogram.ipynb. (Since the code is similar!)

"music_genre_cnn_chroma_feature.ipynb" is the code for training the chroma features using the custom-built CNN. For a step-by-step explanation, please move to music_genre_cnn_melody_spectrogram.ipynb. (Since the code is similar!)

These ipynb notebooks are designed to run on Google Colab with high RAM and T4 GPU.
